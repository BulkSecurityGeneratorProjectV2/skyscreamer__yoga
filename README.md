# Yoga #

Yoga enables client-defined relational queries and out-of-the-box HATEOAS on **your existing** Java-based REST server.

* 3-4x faster speeds in high-latency (e.g. mobile) apps
* Simplified SOA development (esp. across multiple teams)
* Browsable APIs

This demo shows how aggregation can accelerate a service with multiple nested calls: http://yoga-demo-springmvc.cloudfoundry.com/#demo

## Supported Frameworks ##
 + RESTEasy
 + Any RESTful Spring MVC application

## Inspiration ##

## How does this work? ##
Take for example a music-based social network site.  If I'm a user of that site, one of the first things I'd like to do is see my friends' favorite bands.  A standard RESTful navigation approach involves two steps:

1. Get my friends
2. Get their favorite artists

Even if I only have two dozen friends on this site, I'm already making 25 queries to get this data.  On mobile applications, where the latency for individual calls typically runs in the 100s of milliseconds, this would take a minimum of a couple of seconds.  On slower networks and for people who have a lot more friends than I do, this quickly becomes untenable.

With a REST aggregator, you can easily tie the calls together:

    GET /user/1.json?selector=:(friends:(favoriteArtists))

As you go deeper into the tree, the effect is more pronounced.  Imagine I'm using your social site on my mobile phone, and I'd like to build a play list of songs from my friend's favorite artists.  This can still be aggregated as a single query:

    GET /user/1.json?selector=:(friends:(favoriteArtists:(albums:(songs))))

This would be impossible in normal RESTful navigation, since it could require thousands of queries.  Of course, you can write a custom query each time you need something bigger than a single entity or a 1-deep list, but if you can have a framework do it for you it reduces development time, testing time, and code complexity.

In short:

    What                    Why
    ----------              ---
    Fewer requests          Faster response
    Fewer sockets           Fewer servers
    Simpler client code     Happier client developers, less head banging

## How Do I Use It? ##
Yoga works with existing framworks.  To hook it up, you need to add some annotations and a few lines of configuration.  Check out the documentation on our wiki for a more detailed explanation.

For advanced users, we provide hooks to further extend Yoga's capabilities.

Once Yoga has been set up, clients can build and modify their own relational queries without any server-side programming.
